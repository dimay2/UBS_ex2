ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,Target Credential Status by Authentication Protocol - No Credentials Provided,"Nessus was not able to successfully authenticate directly to the
remote target on an available authentication protocol. Nessus was
able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service
running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus
failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided
credentials. There may have been a protocol failure that prevented
authe",,
ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,SSH SHA-1 HMAC Algorithms Enabled,"The remote SSH server is configured to enable SHA-1 HMAC algorithms.

Although NIST has formally deprecated use of SHA-1 for digital signatures, SHA-1 is still considered secure for HMAC as
the security of HMAC does not rely on the underlying hash function being resistant to collisions.

Note that this plugin only checks for the options of the remote SSH server.",,

ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,OS Security Patch Assessment Not Available,"OS Security Patch Assessment is not available on the remote host.
This does not necessarily indicate a problem with the scan.
Credentials may not have been provided, OS security patch assessment
may not be supported for the target, the target may not have been
identified, or another issue may have occurred that prevented OS
security patch assessment from being available. See plugin output for
deta",,
ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,OS Identification,"Using a combination of remote probes (e.g., TCP/IP, SMB, HTTP, NTP,
SNMP, etc.), it is possible to guess the name of the remote operating
system in use. It is also possible sometimes to guess the version of
the operating system.",,
ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,Nessus Scan Information,"This plugin displays, for each tested host, information about the
scan itself :

  - The version of the plugin set.
  - The type of scanner (Nessus or Nessus Home).
  - The version of the Nessus Engine.
  - The port scanner(s) used.
  - The port range scanned.
  - The ping round trip time 
  - Whether credentialed or third-party patch management
    checks are possible.
  - Whether the display of ",,
ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,mDNS Detection (Local Network),"The remote service understands the Bonjour (also known as ZeroConf or
mDNS) protocol, which allows anyone to uncover information from the
remote host such as its operating system type and exact version, its
hostname, and the list of services it is running. 

This plugin attempts to discover mDNS used by hosts residing on the same
network segment as Nessus.",,
ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,ICMP Timestamp Request Remote Date Disclosure,"The remote host answers to an ICMP timestamp request.  This allows an
attacker to know the date that is set on the targeted machine, which
may assist an unauthenticated, remote attacker in defeating time-based
authentication protocols.

Timestamps returned from machines running Windows Vista / 7 / 2008 /
2008 R2 are deliberately incorrect, but usually within 1000 seconds of
the actual system time.",0.0,CVE-1999-0524
ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,Ethernet MAC Addresses,"This plugin gathers MAC addresses discovered from both remote probing
of the host (e.g. SNMP and Netbios) and from running local checks
(e.g. ifconfig). It then consolidates the MAC addresses into a single,
unique, and uniform list.",,
ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,Ethernet Card Manufacturer Detection,"Each ethernet MAC address starts with a 24-bit Organizationally 
Unique Identifier (OUI). These OUIs are registered by IEEE.",,
ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,Device Type,"Based on the remote operating system, it is possible to determine
what the remote system type is (eg: a printer, router, general-purpose
computer, etc).",,
ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,Common Platform Enumeration (CPE),"By using information obtained from a Nessus scan, this plugin reports
CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) matches for various hardware and
software products found on a host. 

Note that if an official CPE is not available for the product, this
plugin computes the best possible CPE based on the information
available from the scan.",,
ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,Service Detection,"Nessus was able to identify the remote service by its banner or by
looking at the error message it sends when it receives an HTTP
request.",,
ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,Nessus SYN scanner,"This plugin is a SYN 'half-open' port scanner.  It shall be reasonably
quick even against a firewalled target. 

Note that SYN scans are less intrusive than TCP (full connect) scans
against broken services, but they might cause problems for less robust
firewalls and also leave unclosed connections on the remote target, if
the network is loaded.",,
ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,Unencrypted Telnet Server,"The remote host is running a Telnet server over an unencrypted
channel.

Using Telnet over an unencrypted channel is not recommended as logins,
passwords, and commands are transferred in cleartext. This allows a 
remote, man-in-the-middle attacker to eavesdrop on a Telnet session to
obtain credentials or other sensitive information and to modify
traffic exchanged between a client and server.

SSH ",6.5,
ubuntu1,192.168.0.101,2023-07-08 17:31:28,IP Forwarding Enabled,"The remote host has IP forwarding enabled. An attacker can exploit
this to route packets through the host and potentially bypass some
firewalls / routers / NAC filtering.

Unless the remote host is a router, it is recommended that you disable
IP forwarding.",6.5,CVE-1999-0511
